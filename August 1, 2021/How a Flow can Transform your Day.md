# How a Flow can Transform your Day

Flowductive uses Flows to help manage your day. It's where we get our name!

## What is a Flow?

Think of a Flow like a deck of cards. At the start of your day, Flowductive will help you pick out the right Flow for you. It could have only a few cards, if your busy; it could have many cards if you have much more free time.

Your goal? Get through your entire deck of cards by the end of the day. If your flow has 6 cards, you'll need to complete all 6 cards by midnight in order to finish the Flow.

### What about cards?

Every Flow has several cards. To complete your Flow, you'll have to get through all of your cards.

There are three types of cards:

-   Blue **Grind** cards represent time you dedicate towards completing your tasks.
-   Green **Growth** cards represent time you dedicate towards mental growth.
-   Red **Health** cards represent time you dedicate towards physical growth.

When you start a card, you're committing time to doing a certain type of productive activity. And what you do during the card is up to you-- as long as you stay focused on the card's category.

## Transforming your day

Flows are designed to be non-intrusive with your daily schedule. They're flexible, so you can pause cards, skip cards, and choose to start a card when you know you'll have enough time to complete them.

### Block, don't schedule

The core idea behind Flows revolves around time _blocking_, rather than time _scheduling_. With Flows, you don't need to dread your 3:00-4:00 planned time for completing tasks; instead, you can commit an hour of time to working on tasks once you feel ready.

### Staying motivated

It can be hard to stay motivated. Luckily, Flowductive has an innovative system for rewarding you for your hard work.

We want you to enjoy completing your tasks. That's why we made task completion as satisfying as possible. And, we want you to finish your flows. So, we'll announce your progress to your friends for additional encouragement!
